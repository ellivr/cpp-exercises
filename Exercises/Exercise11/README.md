# EXERCISE 11

Write a program that asks the user to type a positive integer. When the user types a negative value the program writes ERROR and asks for another value. When the user types 0, that means that the last value has been typed and the program must write the average of the positive integers. If the number of typed values is zero the program writes 'NO AVERAGE'.
